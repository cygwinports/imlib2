ldesc: "This is the Imlib 2 library - a library that does image file 
loading and saving as well as rendering, manipulation, arbitrary 
polygon support, etc.
It does ALL of these operations FAST. Imlib2 also tries to be highly
intelligent about doing them, so writing naive programs can be done
easily, without sacrificing speed."
